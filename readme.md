# Simple blog

I built this simple blog with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP Framework.

In this app admin can login, add avpost and also edit or delete a post, also add comments and delete them.

This app is inspired by [Mackenzie Child](https://github.com/mackenziechild). Here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI_VnnOLSKY) where he built this blog in Rails 4.
